<p>The purpose of Hello Skyy is To provide a central hub, on decentralized infrastructure, to educate, document, and assemble the information, tools, and collaborative development space needed, as we explore an alternative to the crippling control over people that big tech companies employ as a lucrative business model. We want to offer an alternative to big tech, and teach people how to choose freedom and privacy over convenience by exploring web3, blockchain, decentralization, and open source technologies.</p>

<h1>FluxEdge AI Toolbox.</h1>

<p>FluxEdge AI Toolbox is designed to streamline the configuration of container environments on FluxEdge by automating the installation of required packages and dependencies for various AI frameworks and models. Our aim is to enable users to focus more on learning AI and less on grappling with technical setup.</p>

<p>The toolbox utilizes a bash script to install Ansible and adheres to the principles of "infrastructure as code." Accessed through FluxEdge's Terminal GUI, it prompts users to specify their desired environment based on their intended framework or model. Subsequently, it executes a series of Ansible "plays" to configure the necessary packages and dependencies.</p>

<p>These tools are freely available to the community for both private and public use. </p>

<p> To run AI Toolbox copy/past the follwoing command into the terminal GUI on FluxEdge, then follow the prompts. </p>
